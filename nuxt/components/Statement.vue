      a reflection on the ambiguity and hybridity of growing up in an
      agglomeration, themes of identity, classism, and the feeling of being
      ‘in-between’ naturally emerge — caught between city and countryside, poor
      and rich, the working class and academics, apartment buildings and family
      homes.

      in my artistic practice, these experiences and emotions, often rooted in
      autobiographical moments, intersect with the mechanisms and philosophies
      of computer technology, shaped by the internet and the principles of the
      copyleft movement. these ideas and concepts are collected and stored
      across different spaces — not fully synchronized or comprehensible.
      through this decentralized process, thoughts are combined and translated
      into material output, including sculpture, video, new media installations,
      images, and the manipulation of ready-made objects. the resulting work is
      intended to be experienced firstly as an aesthetic object or space, with
      concepts and influences subtly woven into titles, descriptions, and
      deliberate nuances. it should not present a single truth or
      straightforward interpretation; instead, it should provoke reflection and
      encourage personal experience.
